## Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Data Preprocessing üßπ

Data preprocessing is a crucial step that includes cleaning the datasets, handling missing values, and standardizing the features. The following steps are carried out:

- **Concatenation:** The datasets are merged into a single dataframe.
- **Feature Engineering:** Irrelevant features such as 'Forward Packets', 'Forward Bytes', 'Reverse Packets', and 'Reverse Bytes' are dropped.
- **Label Encoding:** The target variable 'Traffic Type' is encoded into categorical codes.

### Model Training and Evaluation üéØ
The project trains and evaluates several machine
learning models:

1. **Model Initialization:**

- Random Forest Classifier
- Gaussian Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

2. **Training:**

- The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
- Each model is trained on the training set.

3. **Evaluation:**

- Models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
- Confusion matrices and ROC curves are generated for a detailed analysis of model performance.
- Learning curves are plotted to observe the model's performance as the training data size increases.

### Model Prediction üîç
The project includes a user interface to input new data for traffic classification. The following steps are followed:

- **User Input:** Users are prompted to input values for specific features.
- **Preprocessing:** The user input is preprocessed using the same scaler applied during model training.
- **Prediction:** Each model provides a prediction for the traffic type based on the input data.

## Visualization and Analysis üìà
The project provides various visual tools to understand model performance:

- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation of the true vs. predicted classifications.
- **ROC Curve:** Displays the trade-off between the true positive rate and false positive rate for each class.
- **Learning Curve:** Shows the performance of the model on the training and validation sets as the amount of training data varies.

## Model Saving and Deployment üíæ
The trained models are saved using Python‚Äôs pickle module, allowing for easy deployment in production environments. This feature is particularly useful for integrating the classification models into larger systems or applications where network traffic classification is required
